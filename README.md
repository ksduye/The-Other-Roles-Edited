### **阵营:内鬼**
The 黑手党 are a group of three Impostors.\

The Mafioso is an Impostor who cannot kill until the Godfather is dead.\
The Janitor is an Impostor who cannot kill, but they can hide dead bodies instead.\

\
**便签:**
- They shrink to the size of the 迷你船员 when they copy its look.
- The 黑客 sees the new color on the admin table.
- The color of the footprints changes accordingly (also the ones that were already on the ground).
- The other Impostor still sees that they are an Impostor (the 名字 remains red).
- The shield indicator changes accordingly (the 化形者 gains or loses the shield indicator).
- 追踪者 arrows keep working.

are hidden and all players have the same color.\

If a victim is near a garlic, the "Bite Button" turns into the default "Kill Button" and the 吸血鬼 can only perform a normal kill.\
\
**便签:**
- If a bitten player is still alive when a meeting is being called, they die at the start of the meeting.
- The cooldown is the same as the default kill cooldown (+ the kill delay if the 吸血鬼 bites the target).
- If there is a 吸血鬼 in the game, there can't be a 术士.
- If the 吸血鬼 bites a player and the 窃贼 kills the 吸血鬼, the bite will still be performed, but the new 吸血鬼 will be displayed in the kill animation.
- If the 吸血鬼 bites a player and gets killed before the bite is performed, the biten player will survive.

The targeted players will lose their role after the meeting right before a player is exiled.\
After every erase, the cooldown increases by 10 seconds.\

By default the 抹除者 can erase everyone but the 卧底 and other Impostors.\
Depending on the options they can also erase them (Impostors will lose their special Impostor ability).\
\
**便签:**

- As the erase is being triggered before the ejection of a player, a 小丑 win would not happen, as the erase will be triggered before.
- 附加职业 will not be erased.

## 豺狼
### **阵营:豺狼**
The 豺狼 is part of an extra team, that tries to eliminate all the other players.\
The 豺狼 has no tasks and can kill Impostors, Crewmates and Neutrals.\
The 豺狼 (if allowed by the options) can select another player to be their 跟班.
Creating a 跟班 removes all tasks of the 跟班 and adds them to the team 豺狼. The 跟班 loses their current role (except if they're a 恋人, then they play in two teams).
The "Create 跟班 Action" may only be used once per 豺狼 or once per game (depending on the options).
The 豺狼 can also promote Impostors to be their 跟班, but depending on the options the Impostor will either really turn into the 跟班 and leave the team Impostors or they will just look like the 跟班 to the 豺狼 and remain as they were.\
Also if a 卧底 or Impostor gets 跟班ed, they still will appear red to the Impostors.

The team 豺狼 enables multiple new outcomes of the game, listing some examples here:
- The Impostors could be eliminated and then the crew plays against the team 豺狼.
- The Crew could be eliminated, then the Team 豺狼 fight against the Impostors (The Crew can still make a task win in this scenario)

The priority of the win conditions is the following:
1. Crewmate 迷你船员 lose by vote
2. 纵火犯 wins by vote
3. 纵火犯 win
4. Team Impostor wins by sabotage
5. Team Crew wins by tasks (also possible if the whole Crew is dead)
6. 恋人s among the last three players win
7. Team 豺狼 wins by outnumbering (When the team 豺狼 contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 Impostors left and team 豺狼 contains no 恋人)
8. Team Impostor wins by outnumbering (When the team Impostors contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 players of the team 豺狼 left and team Impostors contains no 恋人)
9. Team Crew wins by outnumbering (When there is no player of the team 豺狼 and the team Impostors left)

**便签:**
- The 豺狼 (and their 跟班) may be killed by a 警长.
- A 豺狼 cannot target the 迷你船员, while it's growing up. After that they can kill it or select it as its 跟班.
- The Crew can still win, even if all of their members are dead, if they finish their tasks fast enough (That's why converting the last Crewmate with tasks left into a 跟班 results in a task win for the crew.)

If both Impostors and 豺狼s are in the game, the game continues even if all Crewmates are dead. Crewmates may still win in this case by completing their tasks. 豺狼 and Impostor have to kill each other.

## 恋人s

There are always two 恋人s which are linked together.\
Their primary goal is it to stay alive together until the end of the game.\
If one 恋人 dies (and the option is activated), the other 恋人 suicides.\
You can specify the chance of one 恋人 being an Impostor.\
The 恋人s never know the role of their partner, they only see who their partner is.\
The 恋人s win, if they are both alive when the game ends. They can also win with their original team (e.g. a dead Impostor 恋人 can win with the Impostors, an 小丑 恋人 can still achieve an 小丑 win).\
If one of the 恋人s is a killer (i.e. 豺狼/跟班/Impostor), they can achieve a "恋人s solo win" where only the 恋人s win.\
If there is no killer among the 恋人s (e.g. an 小丑 恋人 + Crewmate 恋人) and they are both alive when the game ends, they win together with the Crewmates.\
If there's an Impostor/豺狼 + Crewmate 恋人 in the game, the tasks of a Crewmate 恋人 won't be counted (for a task win) as long as they're alive.\
If the 恋人 dies, their tasks will also be counted.\
You can enable an exclusive chat only for 恋人s.

**便签:**
In a 2 Crewmates vs 2 Impostors (or 2 members of team 豺狼) and the 恋人s are not in the same team, the game is not automatically over since the 恋人s can still achieve a solo win. E.g. if there are the following roles Impostor + Imp恋人 + 恋人 + Crewmate left, the game will not end and the next kill will decide if the Impostors or 恋人s win.

Even if the 交换师 or the target dies before the meeting, the Shift will still be performed.\

- One time use abilities (e.g. shielding a player or 工程师 sabotage fix) can only used by one player in the game (i.e. the 交换师
can only use them, if the previous player did not use them before)
